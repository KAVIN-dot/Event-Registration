        <p>Documenting your event‚Äôs voice also makes it easier to connect with readers on an emotional level. 
            And that, according to Michael Meyer, Creative Director at Eventbrite, is the secret sauce to taking 
            your description of an event from good to great. ‚ÄúA good event description tells the reader everything 
             do both with a compelling description that connects with your audience on an emotional level and makes 
             it as clear and easy as possible to actually attend your event.‚Äù</p>
